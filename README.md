# Airline Passenger Satisfaction Classifier: Project Overview
- Produced a model that accurately predicts the satisfaction of airline passengers
- Uncovered patterns within the data after data cleaning and creatied insightful, descriptive data visualizations
- Explored various classifiers, including Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Gradient Booster, and others, using different scoring metrics to identify the optimal model for this scenario
- Conducted hyperparameter tuning on the best-fitting model, which was the XGBoost Classifier
